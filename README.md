# Angular Explorations

- Pomodoro Timer

### Application Design

I really focused on getting to know Angular 1.4 and using test driven development throughout
the process. It is not intended to be pretty, but the testing coverage should be 100%. 

### Things I'd Love To Do Next

- Test with Protractor
- Add routes
- Add Angular 2 components
- Create a service that just returns an anonymous function, perhaps with a "configuration object"
- Run karma with multiple browsers
-
