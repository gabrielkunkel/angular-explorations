# Angular Explorations

- Pomodoro Timer

### Application Design

I really focused on getting to know Angular 1.4 and using test driven development throughout
the process. It is not intended to be pretty, but the testing coverage should be 100%. 

### Things I'd Love To Do Next

- Add testing with Protractor
- Add routes for different sized micro-projects
- Add some Angular 2
